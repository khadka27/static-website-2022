                <p class="blogcontent2">
                    In the realm of science fiction, there are plenty of stories focused on technology that ends up
                    having a sinister effect on humankind. And as technology continues to play a greater role in our
                    work and personal lives, cautionary tales have arisen that remind us that even tools created with
                    the best intentions can cause unexpected problems.
                    <br><br>
                    However, there's no doubt technology has also added significant improvements in the lives of people
                    around the globe, including recent, rapidly deployed health, workplace and commerce technologies.
                    Below, experts from Forbes Technology Council share their selections for technologies that have had
                    a truly positive impact on the greater good. <span id="dots0">...</span><span id="more0"><br><br>
                        <b>Home Fitness Tech</b><br>
                        The pandemic has caused an entire cottage industry to spring up around the concept of the home
                        gym. Many startups have launched innovative new products in the digital gym arena that focus on
                        ease of use and space-saving design. Artificial intelligence has added features to these
                        products that bring all the benefits of a personal trainer without having to step out of your
                        home. <br><br><b>Water Technology</b> <br>Affordable water-treatment technologies such as solar
                        water disinfection (SODIS) and ceramic and biosand water filtration help to provide drinkable
                        water for many of the estimated 2.3 billion people living in water-scarce areas.
                        <br><br><b>Digital Payment Technology</b><br>Digital payment technologies such as Venmo and
                        Square have revolutionized the way businesses and consumers send and receive money. These apps
                        have enabled access for those without traditional payment methods. Amid the pandemic, businesses
                        can continue serving customers safely and securely by pivoting to digital platforms, which also
                        mitigate the environmental costs associated with paper-based methods. <br><br><b>EdTech</b><br>
                        The world has been reshaped by technology, and nothing is more due for an update than the
                        current educational system. This era of hyperconnectivity is allowing educators to tap into the
                        digital era and adopt new technologies to help students reach their full potential. Edtech is
                        having a truly positive impact on the greater good by democratizing access to education.
                        <br><br><b>Blockchain</b>When people hear “blockchain,” they think cryptocurrency—but really,
                        blockchain technology is about transparency. Used right, it ensures trust and accountability.
                        With so much attention shifting to environmental, social and governance issues there's a rising
                        need for companies to quantify their emissions and sustainability efforts so investors can
                        verify their data. Because of this, blockchain is going to play a pivotal role in addressing
                        climate change.

                    <b>Negative Impact Of Technology</b>
                </div>
                <p class="blogcontent3">From smartphones and social media to TV and tablet-based toys, today's kids are
                    constantly inundated by technology. While it's important for children and teens to develop an
                    aptitude for technology, after all, they will use computers their whole lives, too much technology
                    use can have detrimental health and physical effects. The negative effects on children's health run
                    the gamut from increased risk of obesity to loss of social skills and behavioral problems. Of
                    course, this doesn't mean parents need to ban technology entirely, but it's important for parents to
                    be aware of the potential effects of technology on children and develop strategies to limit their
                    children's screen time. <span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1">
                        <br><br>Technology has completely changed the way we interact with each other. Even as adults,
                        we are more prone to send a text vs. make a phone call. Similarly, we often behave differently
                        on social media than we would in person. These differences aren't exclusive to adults. Teens are
                        seeing curated content, a digital highlight reel, which can lead to distress due to teens
                        comparing themselves to their peers. In general, technology use can cause social and behavioral
                        problems in children because it minimizes the amount of time kids spend interacting with others.
                        Make sure to monitor your child's social media use and be aware of the types of websites they're
                        visiting and the games they're playing online.In addition to monitoring your child's screen
                        time, it's also important to make sure they engage in social activities. Schedule playdates with
                        friends and encourage your child to interact with others. Another great way to limit screen time
                        and encourage physical activity and social interaction is to enroll your kids in a sports
                        league. This way, they will have organized practices and games that will allow them to not only
                        exercise but be social with other kids their age.<br><br>Gone are the days where we have to
                        rewind a VHS cassette tape to watch a movie or listen to the radio all day to hear our favorite
                        song. With the Internet and YouTube, you can watch a show or listen to a song almost instantly,
                        and you can even skip through the commercials. As a result, kids today are wired for instant
                        gratification; they want what they want, and they want it now.It's challenging enough to teach
                        kids patience, but how can we combat the negative effects of this always-on culture? One way is
                        to limit technology use while children are focused on other tasks. Prohibit smartphone use while
                        working on homework, encourage conversation and interaction during dinner time, turn the TV off
                        while children are reading. Encourage your kids to take time to unplug and disconnect. Get
                        outside, interact with others, and engage in activities that don't involve screens, like board
                        games, books, and puzzles. <br><br>Do you know how much time your kids spend per day on their
                        devices? According to the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), teenagers
                        spend up to nine hours per day watching or using screens, and children ages eight to 12, spend
                        four to six hours a day using screens. While some electronic use is vital for schoolwork,
                        especially with distance learning, parents should try to limit screen time, be aware of the
                        websites their kids are visiting, and make sure kids are spending their time watching
                        high-quality educational content.

                <div class="lastBlogContent1">
                    Training a bonsai tree to grow into a thing of beauty is a time-consuming process, involving pruning
                    and wiring branches to develop the perfect shape. It has a lot in common with democracy - also a
                    surprisingly fragile thing in need of constant attention and nurturing.
                    <span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2">
                        Unfortunately, like a neglected bonsai, democracy is
                        being twisted and distorted out of shape by a toxic mix of factors: the power and influence of
                        global technology players; non-democratic states shaping technology into a tool of surveillance
                        and control, as well as manipulating it to amplify dissent and dissatisfaction in liberal
                        democracies; politicians who see technology as a tool to disadvantage their opponents; and,
                        probably the biggest factor of all, the failure of democratic countries to ensure technology is
                        used as a force for good. <br><br>There's a notable lack of understanding of technology in most
                        policymaking and legal circles - and a worrying lack of comprehension of its wider human,
                        social, economic and political impacts. At their worst, governments have also cynically
                        amplified the problems, adopting intrusive technologies pioneered in unaccountable global
                        corporates and totalitarian states that are anathema to democracy.

                    Technology has greatly impacted the way bonsai plants are sold. The following are some of the ways
                    technology has impacted the selling of bonsai plants:
                    <span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3"> <br><br>
                        <b>1. Online marketplaces:</b> Online marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay provide bonsai plant
                        sellers
                        with a platform to reach a large audience of potential buyers. <br><br>

                        <b>2. Social media:</b> Social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram have allowed
                        bonsai plant
                        sellers to reach a larger audience, interact with customers, and promote their products.
                        <br><br>

                        <b>3. E-commerce websites:</b> Bonsai plant sellers can now create their own e-commerce websites
                        to
                        sell
                        their products directly to customers. <br><br>

                        <b>4. Mobile commerce:</b> Mobile devices and mobile commerce have made it easier for customers
                        to buy
                        bonsai plants from anywhere at any time. <br><br>

                        <b>5. Product visualization:</b> Online product visualization tools such as 3D images and
                        augmented
                        reality can help bonsai plant sellers showcase their products in a more engaging way, leading to
                        higher sales. <br><br>

                        Overall, technology has made it easier and more convenient for both bonsai plant sellers and
                        buyers to connect and conduct transactions.

                    While technology has had many positive impacts on the selling of bonsai plants, it has also had some
                    negative impacts. Some of the negative impacts include: <span id="dots4">...</span><span id="more4">
                        <br><br>Competition: Technology has made it easier for new entrants to enter the market,
                        increasing competition and potentially leading to lower prices and reduced profit margins for
                        bonsai plant sellers. <br><br>

                        <b>1. Counterfeit products:</b> Online marketplaces are prone to counterfeit products, which can
                        harm the
                        reputation of bonsai plant sellers and negatively impact sales. <br><br>

                        <b>2. Shipping challenges:</b> Shipping live plants can be challenging, and technology has not
                        yet been
                        able to completely resolve these challenges, leading to potential damage to plants during
                        shipping and dissatisfied customers. <br><br>

                        <b>3. Dependence on technology:</b> Bonsai plant sellers may become overly dependent on
                        technology, which
                        can lead to increased costs and decreased personal interaction with customers. <br><br>

                        <b>4. Cybersecurity concerns:</b> E-commerce websites and online marketplaces are vulnerable to
                        cyber
                        attacks, which can result in loss of sensitive customer information and harm the reputation of
                        bonsai plant sellers. <br><br>

                        Overall, while technology has greatly impacted the selling of bonsai plants, it is important for
                        sellers to be aware of the potential negative impacts and take steps to mitigate them.
